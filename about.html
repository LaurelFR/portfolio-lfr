                <p>When I found myself describing my latest piece of code as
                    “elegant,” I knew I was
                    hooked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For a long time, my passion was psychology. It was my dream to become a therapist and help
                    people every day. After I got
                    my BA in Psychology, I was on track to achieve my goals. I started graduate school in counseling
                    psychology and then… I
                    gradually realized that being a therapist wasn’t for me. I started researching different career
                    paths and eventually I
                    stumbled upon a JavaScript tutorial.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Coding was fascinating. Gripping. I was eager to learn as much as I could. I’ve run into my
                    share of frustrating
                    problems, but for me, coding is like an endless puzzle I am determined to solve - and I have
                    always loved puzzles.
                    Coding is engaging and creative, and I can’t stop learning more. I have had to force myself to
                    slow down and not get
                    carried away trying to learn too much at once. Front-end web development plays to all my
                    strengths and passions. It
                    involves attention to detail, creativity, problem solving, patience and communication.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I still love psychology - and I will bring my knowledge of the mind and behavior into my career
                    as a Front-end web
                    developer. Coding involves a lot of communication - from my code, to the computer, to the user,
                    and while working with
                    other developers. I also love making my websites responsive and accessible to all. I consider
                    user expectations and
                    experience when creating a website, keeping in mind users with disabilities and those who are
                    using screen readers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My current skills include JavaScript, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, React.js, VS Code, CLI, and
                    Git/GitHub. I am working hard to
                    learn more and strengthen these skills. I am currently learning advanced React.js, and intend to
                    start learning more
                    programming languages, frameworks, and principles including Node.js, Next.js, and TypeScript.
